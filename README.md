These projects represent a sample of homework assignments completed for RIT's Machine Learning Applications course and RIT's Graduate Computational Statistics Course. Only a sample of turned in projects are available here, and a good portion of the code was provided to be filled in by the student. Nonetheless, this remains as a demonstration of my ability to train machine learning algorithms. All projects are written to be run in VScode as a jupyter notebook using Python 3.7+

All projects completed by Kinzie Bailey, save for HW6, which represents a collaborative effort between Kinzie Bailey and Brian Yoon.
