This project represents the collaborative efforts of Kinzie Bailey and Andrew Lomeli pursuant to the fulfillment of a class machine learning project. In this project, we utilize 
a csv format dataset from Kaggle and tools from the pandas, numpy, and sci-kitlearn libraries in Python 3.7. 

This project was designed in visual studio code as a jupyter notebook for the sake of ease of presentation and workflow. In this project, we produce a significant improvement 
in predictive ability of our machine learning models over baseline given an imbalanced dataset and much data engineering. It is recommended to have at least Python 3.7 installed to
run this project.
